# IT114
## By: Filipe Atanes
Hello and welcome. This is my main branch for my first repository that I made for my IT114 class.
I am majoring in Information Technology. I use most of my free time gaming, reading, watching shows, or making some digital design.
Thank you for reading a little bit about me. Soon enough this repo will be full of information, I'm sure.
But for now, I'll use this space to talk a little bit about myself.
I wish you the best :D
